## Description
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
This project takes you under the hood of SpaceX’s rocket landing decisions using real launch data and robust
machine learning models. By exploring multiple classification techniques—including Logistic Regression, SVMs,
Decision Trees, and KNN—this analysis doesn’t just identify if a rocket lands, but why.

I conducted a full pipeline—from preprocessing and standardization to hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV
and model comparison—to determine the most accurate classifier. The result? A Decision Tree model with
optimized parameters and insights that make model behavior explainable to both technical and business
stakeholders.

Whether you’re in mission control or the boardroom, this dashboard helps make sense of performance trade-offs
across algorithms and identifies the best predictors of a successful Falcon 9 landing.

*SpaceX Project* is aimed at predicting if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully, and answering other questions on how the features interact to affect landing success and cost.
These project codes are mostly written with `Jupyter notebooks` on `IBM Watson Cloud`, `Skills Network Lab` and `Visual Studio`.
